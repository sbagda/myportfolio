The Amazon clone is a web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, replicating the functionality and design of the popular e-commerce platform. Users can browse products, view detailed descriptions, and add items to their cart. The interface mimics Amazon's layout, featuring categories, search functionality, and personalized recommendations. CSS styling ensures a visually appealing presentation, while JavaScript handles dynamic content updates, such as real-time cart updates and user authentication. Despite being a clone, the project showcases the developer's skills in front-end web development and provides a practical exercise in building a complex web application from scratch.
